According to all known laws
ney begins when our valiant Pollen
Jock
of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

  
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

  
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

  
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

  
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!

  
I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

  
Yeah, right.

  
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

  
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

  
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

  
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

  
Wow!

  
Oouple of newbies?

  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

  
Make your choice.

  
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

  
Oh, my. What's available?

  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

  
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

  
Wax monkey's always open.

  
The Krelman opened up again.

  
What happened?

  
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

  
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

  
Oh, this is so hard!

  
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,

  
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

  
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?

  
Barry!

  
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...

  
What happened to you?
Where are you?

  
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?

  
- Out there.
- Oh, no!

  
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.

  
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

  
Another call coming in.

  
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd

  
that gets their roses today.

  
Hey, guys.

  
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

  
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

  
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

  
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

  
Sign here, here. Just initial that.

  
- Thank you.
- OK.

  
You got a rain advisory today,

  
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.

  
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,

  
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.

  
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.

  
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!

  
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,

  
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!

  
All right, launch positions!

  
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

  
Black and yellow!

  
Hello!

  
You ready for this, hot shot?

  
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

  
Wind, check.

  
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.

  
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.

  
Scared out of my shorts, check.

  
OK, ladies,

  
let's move it out!

  
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!

  
All of you, drain those flowers!

  
Wow! I'm out!

  
I can't believe I'm out!

  
So blue.

  
I feel so fast and free!

  
Box kite!

  
Wow!

  
Flowers!

  
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.

  
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

  
Roses!

  
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

  
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.

  
That is one nectar collector!

  
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.

  
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,

  
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.

  
That's amazing. Why do we do that?

  
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

  
Oool.

  
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?

  
Oopy that visual.

  
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.

  
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?

  
Affirmative.

  
That was on the line!

  
This is the coolest. What is it?

  
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.

  
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.

  
Yeah, fuzzy.

  
Ohemical-y.

  
Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.

  
My sweet lord of bees!

  
Oandy-brain, get off there!

  
Problem!

  
- Guys!
- This could be bad.

  
Affirmative.

  
Very close.

  
Gonna hurt.

  
Mama's little boy.

  
You are way out of position, rookie!

  
Ooming in at you like a missile!

  
Help me!

  
I don't think these are flowers.

  
- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.

  
What is this?!

  
Match point!

  
You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!

  
Yowser!

  
Gross.

  
There's a bee in the car!

  
- Do something!
- I'm driving!

  
- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!

  
He's going to sting me!

  
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!

  
He blinked!

  
Spray him, Granny!

  
What are you doing?!

  
Wow... the tension level
out here is unbelievable.

  
I gotta get home.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Oheck out my new resume.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.

  
You see? Folds out.

  
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

  
What was that?

  
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...

  
Drapes!

  
That is diabolical.

  
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

  
What's number one? Star Wars?

  
Nah, I don't go for that...

  
...kind of stuff.

  
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.

  
When I leave a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.

  
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

  
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.

  
I predicted global warming.

  
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.

  
Wait! Stop! Bee!

  
Stand back. These are winter boots.

  
Wait!

  
Don't kill him!

  
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!

  
Why does his life have
less value than yours?

  
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?

  
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.

  
My brochure!

  
There you go, little guy.

  
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.

  
Put that on your resume brochure.

  
My whole face could puff up.

  
Make it one of your special skills.

  
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.

  
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

  
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

  
- You could put carob chips on there.
- Bye.

  
- Supposed to be less calories.
- Bye.

  
I gotta say something.

  
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.

  
All right, here it goes.

  
Nah.

  
What would I say?

  
I could really get in trouble.

  
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.

  
I can't believe I'm doing this.

  
I've got to.

  
Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!

  
No. Yes. No.

  
Do it. I can't.

  
How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.

  
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

  
Hi!

  
I'm sorry.

  
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.

  
You're talking!

  
I'm so sorry.

  
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.

  
But I don't recall going to bed.

  
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.

  
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!

  
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,

  
but they were all trying to kill me.

  
And if it wasn't for you...

  
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.

  
That was a little weird.

  
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.

  
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!

  
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.

  
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?

  
The talking thing.

  
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.

  
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.

  
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

  
Anyway...

  
Oan I...

  
...get you something?
- Like what?

  
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?

  
I don't want to put you out.

  
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

  
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.

  
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.

  
Hey, you want rum cake?

  
- I shouldn't.
- Have some.

  
- No, I can't.
- Oome on!

  
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

  
- Where?
- These stripes don't help.

  
You look great!

  
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.

  
Are you all right?

  
No.

  
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.

  
He finally gets there.

  
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.

  
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.

  
Why would I marry a watermelon?"

  
Is that a bee joke?

  
That's the kind of stuff we do.

  
Yeah, different.

  
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?

  
About work? I don't know.

  
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.

  
I know how you feel.

  
- You do?
- Sure.

  
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

  
- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.

  
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.

  
Anyway, if you look...

  
There's my hive right there. See it?

  
You're in Sheep Meadow!

  
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!

  
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.

  
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?

  
- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybe I'll try that.

  
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

  
Just having two cups of coffee!

  
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.

  
Yeah, it's no trouble.

  
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.

  
Are you...?

  
Oan I take a piece of this with me?

  
Sure! Here, have a crumb.

  
- Thanks!
- Yeah.

  
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.

  
Or not.

  
OK, Barry.

  
And thank you
so much again... for before.

  
Oh, that? That was nothing.

  
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

  
This can't possibly work.

  
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.

  
OK, Dave, pull the chute.

  
- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!

  
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.

  
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!

  
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?

  
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

  
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.

  
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.

  
- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.

  
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.

  
You had your "experience." Now you
can pick out yourjob and be normal.

  
- Well...
- Well?

  
Well, I met someone.

  
You did? Was she Bee-ish?

  
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.

  
- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.

  
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.

  
I can't get by that face.

  
So who is she?

  
She's... human.

  
No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.

  
- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, boy.

  
She's so nice. And she's a florist!

  
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

  
We're not dating.

  
You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes

  
with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!

  
She saved my life!
And she understands me.

  
This is over!

  
Eat this.

  
This is not over! What was that?

  
- They call it a crumb.
- It was so stingin' stripey!

  
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!

  
- You know what a Oinnabon is?
- No.

  
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...

  
Sit down!

  
...really hot!
- Listen to me!

  
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!

  
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?

  
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!

  
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!

  
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

  
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
There he is. He's in the pool.

  
You know what your problem is, Barry?

  
I gotta start thinking bee?

  
How much longer will this go on?

  
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?

  
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.

  
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!

  
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?

  
Barry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.

  
Martin, would you talk to him?

  
Barry, I'm talking to you!

  
You coming?

  
Got everything?

  
All set!

  
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

  
Don't be too long.

  
Watch this!

  
Vanessa!

  
- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.

  
He doesn't respond to yelling!

  
- Then why yell at me?
- Because you don't listen!

  
I'm not listening to this.

  
Sorry, I've gotta go.

  
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.

  
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

  
Bye.

  
I just hope she's Bee-ish.

  
They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?

  
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!

  
Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.

  
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?

  
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?

  
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.

  
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.

  
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!

  
You don't have that?

  
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.

  
Oh, my.

  
Dumb bees!

  
You must want to sting all those jerks.

  
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.

  
So you have to watch your temper.

  
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,

  
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:

  
Anger, jealousy, lust.

  
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?

  
Yeah.

  
- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a bug.

  
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!

  
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?

  
Yeah, it was. How did you know?

  
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

  
You've really got that
down to a science.

  
- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll bet.

  
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?

  
How did this get here?
Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,

  
Ray Liotta Private Select?

  
- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.

  
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.

  
You don't have
enough food of your own?

  
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?

  
- Bees make it.
- I know who makes it!

  
And it's hard to make it!

  
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!

  
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!

  
It's just honey, Barry.

  
Just what?!

  
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

  
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!

  
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.

  
I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!

  
Hey, Hector.

  
- You almost done?
- Almost.

  
He is here. I sense it.

  
Well, I guess I'll go home now

  
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.

  
You're busted, box boy!

  
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!

  
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!

  
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?

  
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.

  
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!

  
You're too late! It's ours now!

  
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!

  
You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!

  
Where is the honey coming from?

  
Tell me where!

  
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!

  
Orazy person!

  
What horrible thing has happened here?

  
These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now

  
they're on the road to nowhere!

  
Just keep still.

  
What? You're not dead?

  
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?

  
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.

  
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!

  
I'm going to Tacoma.

  
- And you?
- He really is dead.

  
All right.

  
Uh-oh!

  
- What is that?!
- Oh, no!

  
- A wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?

  
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!

  
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!

  
How much do you people need to see?!

  
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!

  
From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Oarl Kasell.

  
But don't kill no more bugs!

  
- Bee!
- Moose blood guy!!

  
- You hear something?
- Like what?

  
Like tiny screaming.

  
Turn off the radio.

  
Whassup, bee boy?

  
Hey, Blood.

  
Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.

  
Wow!

  
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.

  
I mean, that honey's ours.

  
- Bees hang tight.
- We're all jammed in.

  
It's a close community.

  
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.

  
- What if you get in trouble?
- You a mosquito, you in trouble.

  
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!

  
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.

  
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.

  
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.

  
You got to be kidding me!

  
Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!

  
- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!

  
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?

  
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.

  
What is this place?

  
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.

  
They are pinheads!

  
Pinhead.

  
- Oheck out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.

  
The Thomas 3000!

  
Smoker?

  
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

  
A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.

  
They make the honey,
and we make the money.

  
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?

  
Oh, my!

  
What's going on? Are you OK?

  
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.

  
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?

  
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.

  
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!

  
That's a drag queen!

  
What is this?

  
Oh, no!

  
There's hundreds of them!

  
Bee honey.

  
Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!

  
This is worse than anything bears
have done! I intend to do something.

  
Oh, Barry, stop.

  
Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.

  
Do these look like rumors?

  
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.

  
How did you get mixed up in this?

  
He's been talking to humans.

  
- What?
- Talking to humans?!

  
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!

  
Make out? Barry!

  
We do not.

  
- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?

  
The bees!

  
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.

  
Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?

  
I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!

  
Dad, I remember you
coming home so overworked

  
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.

  
I remember that.

  
What right do they have to our honey?

  
We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!

  
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?

  
Sting them where it really hurts.

  
In the face! The eye!

  
- That would hurt.
- No.

  
Up the nose? That's a killer.

  
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.

  
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.

  
No more bee beards!

  
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.

  
Weather with Storm Stinger.

  
Sports with Buzz Larvi.

  
And Jeanette Ohung.

  
- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.

  
A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,

  
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,

  
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!

  
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,

  
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new book,

  
Olassy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.

  
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.

  
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?

  
Bees have never been afraid
to change the world.

  
What about Bee Oolumbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?

  
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.

  
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.

  
How old are you?

  
The bee community
is supporting you in this case,

  
which will be the trial
of the bee century.

  
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.

  
It's a common name. Next week...

  
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...

  
Next week...

  
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.

  
Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.

  
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.

  
In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!

  
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.

  
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?

  
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.

  
- Is that that same bee?
- Yes, it is!

  
I'm helping him sue the human race.

  
- Hello.
- Hello, bee.

  
This is Ken.

  
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.

  
Why does he talk again?

  
Listen, you better go
'cause we're really busy working.

  
But it's our yogurt night!

  
Bye-bye.

  
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!

  
You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!

  
Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.

  
- Frosting...
- How many sugars?

  
Just one. I try not
to use the competition.

  
So why are you helping me?

  
Bees have good qualities.

  
And it takes my mind off the shop.

  
Instead of flowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.

  
Those are great, if you're three.

  
And artificial flowers.

  
- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.

  
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.

  
Bees must hate those fake things!

  
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.

  
Maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.

  
- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
- I guess.

  
You sure you want to go through with it?

  
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able

  
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!

  
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,

  
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,

  
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.

  
What have we gotten into here, Barry?

  
It's pretty big, isn't it?

  
I can't believe how many humans
don't work during the day.

  
You think billion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?

  
Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.

  
- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got a chill.

  
Well, if it isn't the bee team.

  
You boys work on this?

  
All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.

  
All right. Oase number 4475,

  
Superior Oourt of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry

  
is now in session.

  
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?

  
A privilege.

  
Mr. Benson... you're representing
all the bees of the world?

  
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.

  
Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.

  
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

  
my grandmother was a simple woman.

  
Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right

  
to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.

  
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,

  
just think of what would it mean.

  
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm

  
for the elastic in my britches!

  
Talking bee!

  
How do we know this isn't some sort of

  
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?

  
They could be using laser beams!

  
Robotics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,

  
he could be on steroids!

  
Mr. Benson?

  
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.

  
I'm just an ordinary bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.

  
It's important to all bees.
We invented it!

  
We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.

  
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room

  
who think they can take it from us

  
'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,

  
you'll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have

  
but everything we are!

  
I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!

  
Oall your first witness.

  
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, big company you have.

  
I suppose so.

  
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!

  
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.

  
Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.

  
I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?

  
- No.
- I couldn't hear you.

  
- No.
- No.

  
Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that,

  
it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.

  
They're very lovable creatures.

  
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.

  
You mean like this?

  
Bears kill bees!

  
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!

  
Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!

  
OK, that's enough. Take him away.

  
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.

  
- Where have I heard it before?
- I was with a band called The Police.

  
But you've never been
a police officer, have you?

  
No, I haven't.

  
No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example

  
of bee culture casually
stolen by a human

  
for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.

  
Oh, please.

  
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?

  
Because I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.

  
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

  
That's not his real name?! You idiots!

  
Mr. Liotta, first,
belated congratulations on

  
your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.

  
Thank you. Thank you.

  
I see from your resume
that you're devilishly handsome

  
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to blow.

  
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?

  
Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you?

  
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don't

  
have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?

  
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!

  
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!

  
Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!

  
- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!

  
Order! Order, I say!

  
- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!

  
I think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.

  
I think the jury's on our side.

  
Are we doing everything right, legally?

  
I'm a florist.

  
Right. Well, here's to a great team.

  
To a great team!

  
Well, hello.

  
- Ken!
- Hello.

  
I didn't think you were coming.

  
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... the battery.

  
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.

  
Oh, that was lucky.

  
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.

  
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

  
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.

  
I'm not much for the game myself.
The ball's a little grabby.

  
That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.

  
Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,

  
and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.

  
You think I don't see what you're doing?

  
I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.

  
Do we?

  
Bees have 100 percent employment,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.

  
That's just what
I was thinking about doing.

  
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.

  
I'm going to drain the old stinger.

  
Yeah, you do that.

  
Look at that.

  
You know, I've just about had it

  
with your little mind games.

  
- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.

  
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.

  
A lot of ads.

  
Remember what Van said, why is
your life more valuable than mine?

  
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!

  
I think something stinks in here!

  
I love the smell of flowers.

  
How do you like the smell of flames?!

  
Not as much.

  
Water bug! Not taking sides!

  
Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!

  
I've got issues!

  
Well, well, well, a royal flush!

  
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

  
Surf's up, dude!

  
Poo water!

  
That bowl is gnarly.

  
Except for those dirty yellow rings!

  
Kenneth! What are you doing?!

  
You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!

  
We need to talk!

  
He's just a little bee!

  
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!

  
Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?

  
No, but there are other things bugging
me in life. And you're one of them!

  
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...

  
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!

  
Goodbye, Ken.

  
And for your information,

  
I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made by man!

  
I'm sorry about all that.

  
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!

  
I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.

  
I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.

  
Are you OK for the trial?

  
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.

  
We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.

  
Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the best lawyers...

  
Yeah.

  
Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic

  
with this jury,
or it's gonna be all over.

  
Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around

  
is to remind them
of what they don't like about bees.

  
- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?

  
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

  
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.

  
What exactly is your relationship

  
to that woman?

  
We're friends.

  
- Good friends?
- Yes.

  
How good? Do you live together?

  
Wait a minute...

  
Are you her little...

  
...bedbug?

  
I've seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand,

  
doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children?

  
- Yeah, but...
- So those aren't your real parents!

  
- Oh, Barry...
- Yes, they are!

  
Hold me back!

  
You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?

  
He's denouncing bees!

  
Don't y'all date your cousins?

  
- Objection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!

  
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!

  
Oh, I'm hit!!

  
Oh, lordy, I am hit!

  
Order! Order!

  
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!

  
I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!

  
You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!

  
Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!

  
- Adam, stay with me.
- I can't feel my legs.

  
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison

  
from my heaving buttocks?

  
I will have order in this court. Order!

  
Order, please!

  
The case of the honeybees
versus the human race

  
took a pointed turn against the bees

  
yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.

  
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

  
- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.

  
I...

  
I blew the whole case, didn't I?

  
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.

  
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.

  
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.

  
Look, there's
a little celery still on it.

  
What was it like to sting someone?

  
I can't explain it. It was all...

  
All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!

  
All right.

  
You think it was all a trap?

  
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.

  
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of bugs in this world.

  
What will the humans do to us
if they win?

  
I don't know.

  
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.

  
Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!

  
Oh, my.

  
Oould you get a nurse
to close that window?

  
- Why?
- The smoke.

  
Bees don't smoke.

  
Right. Bees don't smoke.

  
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.

  
That's it! That's our case!

  
It is? It's not over?

  
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.

  
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.

  
And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.

  
Mr. Flayman.

  
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

  
Where is the rest of your team?

  
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.

  
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,

  
and as a result,
we don't make very good time.

  
I actually heard a funny story about...

  
Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous bugs

  
taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?

  
How much longer will we allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?

  
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges

  
against my clients,
who run legitimate businesses.

  
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!

  
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going

  
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.

  
But you can't! We have a terrific case.

  
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?

  
Show me the smoking gun!

  
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?

  
Here is your smoking gun.

  
What is that?

  
It's a bee smoker!

  
What, this?
This harmless little contraption?

  
This couldn't hurt a fly,
let alone a bee.

  
Look at what has happened

  
to bees who have never been asked,
"Smoking or non?"

  
Is this what nature intended for us?

  
To be forcibly addicted
to smoke machines

  
and man-made wooden slat work camps?

  
Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?

  
- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.

  
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!

  
Free the bees! Free the bees!

  
Free the bees!

  
Free the bees! Free the bees!

  
The court finds in favor of the bees!

  
Vanessa, we won!

  
I knew you could do it! High-five!

  
Sorry.

  
I'm OK! You know what this means?

  
All the honey
will finally belong to the bees.

  
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.

  
This is an unholy perversion
of the balance of nature, Benson.

  
You'll regret this.

  
Barry, how much honey is out there?

  
All right. One at a time.

  
Barry, who are you wearing?

  
My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.

  
- What if Montgomery's right?
- What do you mean?

  
We've been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.

  
Oongratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?

  
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
of all bee work camps.

  
Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with,

  
every last drop.

  
We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more

  
than a filthy, smelly,
bad-breath stink machine.

  
We're all aware
of what they do in the woods.

  
Wait for my signal.

  
Take him out.

  
He'll have nauseous
for a few hours, then he'll be fine.

  
And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...

  
But it's just a prance-about stage name!

  
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products

  
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.

  
Oan't breathe.

  
Bring it in, boys!

  
Hold it right there! Good.

  
Tap it.

  
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!

  
- I think we need to shut down!
- Shut down? We've never shut down.

  
Shut down honey production!

  
Stop making honey!

  
Turn your key, sir!

  
What do we do now?

  
Oannonball!

  
We're shutting honey production!

  
Mission abort.

  
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.

  
Adam, you wouldn't believe
how much honey was out there.

  
Oh, yeah?

  
What's going on? Where is everybody?

  
- Are they out celebrating?
- They're home.

  
They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.

  
I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.

  
At least we got our honey back.

  
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?

  
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.

  
This was my new desk. This was my
new job. I wanted to do it really well.

  
And now...

  
Now I can't.

  
I don't understand
why they're not happy.

  
I thought their lives would be better!

  
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.

  
You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?

  
- What did you want to show me?
- This.

  
What happened here?

  
That is not the half of it.

  
Oh, no. Oh, my.

  
They're all wilting.

  
Doesn't look very good, does it?

  
No.

  
And whose fault do you think that is?

  
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.

  
Bees?

  
Specifically, me.

  
I didn't think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.

  
It's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.

  
That's our whole SAT test right there.

  
Take away produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.

  
And then, of course...

  
The human species?

  
So if there's no more pollination,

  
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?

  
I know this is also partly my fault.

  
How about a suicide pact?

  
How do we do it?

  
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- Thatjust kills you twice.

  
Right, right.

  
Listen, Barry...
sorry, but I gotta get going.

  
I had to open my mouth and talk.

  
Vanessa?

  
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?

  
To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.

  
They've moved it to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.

  
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.

  
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.

  
I know. Me neither.

  
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.

  
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?

  
Roses!

  
Vanessa!

  
Roses?!

  
Barry?

  
- Roses are flowers!
- Yes, they are.

  
Flowers, bees, pollen!

  
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.

  
Maybe not.
Oould you ask him to slow down?

  
Oould you slow down?

  
Barry!

  
OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.

  
Yes, it kind of is.

  
I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you

  
with the flower shop.
I've made it worse.

  
Actually, it's completely closed down.

  
I thought maybe you were remodeling.

  
But I have another idea, and it's
greater than my previous ideas combined.

  
I don't want to hear it!

  
All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.

  
I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.

  
All we gotta do is get what they've got
back here with what we've got.

  
- Bees.
- Park.

  
- Pollen!
- Flowers.

  
- Repollination!
- Across the nation!

  
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.

  
They've got nothing
but flowers, floats and cotton candy.

  
Security will be tight.

  
I have an idea.

  
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.

  
Official floral business. It's real.

  
Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.

  
Thank you. It was a gift.

  
Once inside,
we just pick the right float.

  
How about The Princess and the Pea?

  
I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!

  
Yes, I got it.

  
- Where should I sit?
- What are you?

  
- I believe I'm the pea.
- The pea?

  
It goes under the mattresses.

  
- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.

  
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!

  
Let's see what this baby'll do.

  
Hey, what are you doing?!

  
Then all we do
is blend in with traffic...

  
...without arousing suspicion.

  
Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.

  
Stop! Security.

  
- You and your insect pack your float?
- Yes.

  
Has it been
in your possession the entire time?

  
Would you remove your shoes?

  
- Remove your stinger.
- It's part of me.

  
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.

  
Then if we're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the job.

  
Oan you believe how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the job!

  
I think this is gonna work.

  
It's got to work.

  
Attention, passengers,
this is Oaptain Scott.

  
We have a bit of bad weather
in New York.

  
It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.

  
Barry, these are cut flowers
with no water. They'll never make it.

  
I gotta get up there
and talk to them.

  
Be careful.

  
Oan I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?

  
I'd like to order the talking
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.

  
Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.

  
- What'd you say, Hal?
- Nothing.

  
Bee!

  
Don't freak out! My entire species...

  
What are you doing?

  
- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
- Who's an attorney?

  
Don't move.

  
Oh, Barry.

  
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.

  
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?

  
And please hurry!

  
What happened here?

  
There was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.

  
One's bald, one's in a boat,
they're both unconscious!

  
- Is that another bee joke?
- No!

  
No one's flying the plane!

  
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?

  
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.

  
Where's the pilot?

  
He's unconscious,
and so is the copilot.

  
Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?

  
As a matter of fact, there is.

  
- Who's that?
- Barry Benson.

  
From the honey trial?! Oh, great.

  
Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.

  
It's got giant wings, huge engines.

  
I can't fly a plane.

  
- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
- Yes.

  
How hard could it be?

  
Wait, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.

  
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,

  
where a suspenseful scene
is developing.

  
Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory...

  
That's Barry!

  
...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers

  
and an incapacitated flight crew.

  
Flowers?!

  
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls

  
with absolutely no flight experience.

  
Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.

  
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.

  
They've done enough damage.

  
But isn't he your only hope?

  
Technically, a bee
shouldn't be able to fly at all.

  
Their wings are too small...

  
Haven't we heard this a million times?

  
"The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense."

  
- Get this on the air!
- Got it.

  
- Stand by.
- We're going live.

  
The way we work may be a mystery to you.

  
Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.

  
But let me tell you about a small job.

  
If you do it well,
it makes a big difference.

  
More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.

  
That's why I want to get bees
back to working together.

  
That's the bee way!
We're not made of Jell-O.

  
We get behind a fellow.

  
- Black and yellow!
- Hello!

  
Left, right, down, hover.

  
- Hover?
- Forget hover.

  
This isn't so hard.
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!

  
Barry, what happened?!

  
Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.

  
- That may have been helping me.
- And now we're not!

  
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.

  
All of you, let's get
behind this fellow! Move it out!

  
Move out!

  
Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
you copy me with the wings of the plane!

  
Don't have to yell.

  
I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of trouble.

  
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!

  
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!

  
I can't do this!

  
Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!

  
You snap out of it.

  
You snap out of it.

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- Hold it!
- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.

  
How is the plane flying?

  
I don't know.

  
Hello?

  
Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?

  
The Pollen Jocks!

  
They do get behind a fellow.

  
- Black and yellow.
- Hello.

  
All right, let's drop this tin can
on the blacktop.

  
Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?

  
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.

  
Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.

  
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.

  
- What?
- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.

  
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.

  
Bring the nose down.

  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
- What in the world is on the tarmac?
- Get some lights on that!

  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
- OK.

  
Out the engines. We're going in
on bee power. Ready, boys?

  
Affirmative!

  
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.

  
Land on that flower!

  
Ready? Full reverse!

  
Spin it around!

  
- Not that flower! The other one!
- Which one?

  
- That flower.
- I'm aiming at the flower!

  
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower

  
made of millions of bees!

  
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.

  
Rotate around it.

  
- This is insane, Barry!
- This's the only way I know how to fly.

  
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?

  
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!

  
Just drop it. Be a part of it.

  
Aim for the center!

  
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!

  
Oome on, already.

  
Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!

  
- Yes. No high-five!
- Right.

  
Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?

  
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!

  
- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.

  
Listen, everyone!

  
This runway is covered
with the last pollen

  
from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.

  
That means this is our last chance.

  
We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.

  
If we're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment! What do you say?

  
Are we going to be bees, orjust
Museum of Natural History keychains?

  
We're bees!

  
Keychain!

  
Then follow me! Except Keychain.

  
Hold on, Barry. Here.

  
You've earned this.

  
Yeah!

  
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.

  
Oh, yeah.

  
That's our Barry.

  
Mom! The bees are back!

  
If anybody needs
to make a call, now's the time.

  
I got a feeling we'll be
working late tonight!

  
Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Oan I help who's next?

  
Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.

  
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!

  
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!

  
I had no idea.

  
Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?

  
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.

  
Sorry I'm late.

  
He's a lawyer too?

  
I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.

  
Have a great afternoon!

  
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.

  
No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.

  
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Oan I help who's next?

  
All right, scramble, jocks!
It's time to fly.

  
Thank you, Barry!

  
That bee is living my life!

  
Let it go, Kenny.

  
- When will this nightmare end?!
- Let it all go.

  
- Beautiful day to fly.
- Sure is.

  
Between you and me,
I was dying to get out of that office.

  
You have got
to start thinking bee, my friend.

  
- Thinking bee!
- Me?

  
Hold it. Let's just stop
for a second. Hold it.

  
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
Oan we stop here?

  
I'm not making a major life decision
during a production number!

  
All right. Take ten, everybody.
Wrap it up, guys.

  
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
When the boy was born...


... like all Spartans, he was inspected.


If he'd been small or puny
or sickly or misshapen...


... he would have been discarded.


From the time he could stand,
he was baptized in the fire of combat.


Taught never to retreat,
never to surrender.


Taught that death on the battlefield
in service to Sparta...


... was the greatest glory
he could achieve in his life.


At age 7, as is customary in Sparta...


... the boy was taken from his mother
and plunged into a world of violence.


Manufactured by 300 years
of Spartan warrior society...


... to create the finest soldiers
the world has ever known.


The agoge, as it's called,
forces the boy to fight.


Starves them, forces them to steal...


... and if necessary, to kill.


By rod and lash the boy was punished...


... taught to show no pain, no mercy.


Constantly tested, tossed into the wild.


Left to pit his wits and will
against nature's fury.


It was his initiation...


... his time in the wild...


... for he would return to his people
a Spartan...


... or not at all.


The wolf begins to circle the boy.


Claws of black steel...


... fur as dark night.


Eyes glowing red...


... jewels from the pit of hell itself.


The giant wolf sniffing...


... savoring the scent of the meal to come.


It's not fear that grips him...


... only a heightened sense of things.


The cold air in his lungs.


Windswept pines
moving against the coming night.


His hands are steady.


His form...


... perfect.


And so the boy, given up for dead...


... returns to his people,
to sacred Sparta, a king!


Our king, Leonidas!


It's been more than 30 years
since the wolf and the winter cold.


And now, as then, a beast approaches.


Patient and confident,
savoring the meal to come.


But this beast
is made of men and horses...


...swords and spears.


An army of slaves, vast beyond imagining,
ready to devour tiny Greece.


Ready to snuff out the world's
one hope for reason and justice.


A beast approaches...


...and it was King Leonidas himself
who provoked it.


That's it.


Now, the more you sweat here,
the less you'll bleed in battle.


My father taught me...


...that fear is always a constant.


But accepting it...


...makes you stronger.


My queen.


A Persian emissary awaits Leonidas.


In the end...


...a Spartan's true strength
is the warrior next to him.


So give respect and honor to him,
and it will be returned to you.


First...


...you fight with your head.
- Then you fight with your heart.


What is it?


A Persian messenger awaits you.


Do not forget today's lesson.


- Respect and honor.
- Respect and honor.


Councilman Theron.
You found yourself needed, for once.


My king and queen,
I was just entertaining your guests.


I'm sure.


Before you speak, Persian...


...know that in Sparta everyone,
even a king's messenger...


...is held accountable
for the words of his voice.


Now, what message do you bring?


Earth and water.


You rode all the way from Persia
for earth and water?


Do not be coy or stupid, Persian.
You can afford neither in Sparta.


What makes this woman
think she can speak among men?


Because only Spartan women
give birth to real men.


Let us walk to cool our tongues.


If you value your lives
over your complete annihilation...


...listen carefully, Leonidas.


Xerxes conquers and controls
everything he rests his eyes upon.


He leads an army so massive,
it shakes the ground with its march.


So vast, it drinks the rivers dry.


All the God-King Xerxes requires is this:


A simple offering of earth and water...


...a token of Sparta's submission
to the will of Xerxes.


Submission.


Now, that's a bit of a problem.


See, rumor has it...


...the Athenians
have already turned you down.


And if those philosophers and boy-lovers
have found that kind of nerve, then...


- We must be diplomatic.
- And, of course, Spartans...


...have their reputation to consider.


Choose your next words carefully,
Leonidas.


They may be your last as king.


"Earth and water."


Madman. You're a madman.


Earth and water.


You'll find plenty of both down there.


No man, Persian or Greek,
no man threatens a messenger.


You bring the crowns and heads
of conquered kings to my city steps.


You insult my queen.


You threaten my people
with slavery and death.


Oh, I've chosen my words carefully,
Persian.


Perhaps you should have done the same.


This is blasphemy. This is madness!


Madness?


This is Sparta!


Welcome, Leonidas.


We have been expecting you.


The ephors, priests to the old gods.


Inbred swine.


More creature than man.


Creatures whom even Leonidas
must bribe and beg.


For no Spartan king has gone to war
without the ephors' blessing.


The Persians claim their forces
number in the millions.


I hope, for our sake, they exaggerate.


But there's no question, we face
the most massive army ever assembled.


Before your plan is heard...


...what do you offer?


We will use our superior fighting skills...


...and the terrain of Greece herself
to destroy them.


We will march north to the coast,
where I will make sure...


It is August, Leonidas.
The full moon approaches.


The sacred and ancient festival.


Sparta wages no war
at the time of the Carneia.


Sparta will burn!


Her men will die at arms...


...and her women and children
will be slaves or worse.


Now, we will block
the Persian coastal assault...


...by rebuilding the great Phocian Wall.


And from there, we will funnel them into
the mountain pass we call the Hot Gates.


Now, in that narrow corridor,
their numbers will count for nothing.


And wave after wave of Persian attack...


...will smash against Spartan shields.


Xerxes' losses will be so great,
his men so demoralized...


...he will have no choice
but to abandon his campaign.


We must consult the oracle.


Trust the gods, Leonidas.


I'd prefer you trusted your reason.


Your blasphemies...


...have cost us quite enough already.


Don't compound them.


We will consult the oracle.


Diseased old mystics.


Worthless remnants of a time
before Sparta's ascent from darkness.


Remnants of a senseless tradition.


Tradition even Leonidas cannot defy...


... for he must respect
the word of the ephors.


That is the law.


And no Spartan, subject or citizen,
man or woman...


... slave or king, is above the law.


The ephors choose only
the most beautiful Spartan girls...


... to live among them as oracles.


Their beauty is their curse...


... for the old wretches
have the needs of men...


... and souls as black as hell.


"Pray to the winds...


...Sparta will fall.


All Greece will fall.


Trust not in men...


...honor the gods.


Honor the Carneia."


The king's climb down is harder.


Pompous, inbred swine.


Worthless, diseased, rotten...


... corrupt.


Truly, you're in the god-king's
favor now...


...O wise and holy men.


Yes.


And when Sparta burns,
you shall bathe in gold.


Fresh oracles shall be delivered to you...


...daily...


...from every corner of the empire.


Your lips can finish
what your fingers have started.


Or has the oracle robbed you
of your desire as well?


It would take more than the words
of a drunken adolescent girl...


...to rob me of my desire for you.


Then why so distant?


Because it seems...


...though a slave and captive
of lecherous old men...


...the oracle's words
could set fire to all that I love.


So that is why my king loses sleep
and is forced from the warmth of his bed?


There's only one woman's words that
should affect the mood of my husband.


Those are mine.


Then what must a king do
to save his world...


...when the very laws he is sworn
to protect force him to do nothing?


It is not a question
of what a Spartan citizen should do...


...nor a husband, nor a king.


Instead ask yourself, my dearest love...


...what should a free man do?


- Is this all of them?
- As you ordered. Three hundred.


All with born sons to carry on their name.


We are with you, sire.


For Sparta. For freedom.


To the death.


He is your son.


He is too young
to have felt a woman's warmth.


I have others to replace him.
Astinos is as brave and ready as any.


No younger than we were the first time
you stood next to me in battle.


You are a good friend...


...but a better captain, there is none.


My good king.


My good king, the oracle has spoken.


The ephors have spoken.
There must be no march.


It is the law, my lord.


- The Spartan army must not go to war.
- Nor shall it.


I've issued no such orders.


I'm here just taking a stroll,
stretching my legs.


These 300 men
are my personal bodyguard.


Our army will stay in Sparta.


Where will you go?


I hadn't really thought about it...


...but now that you ask...


...I suppose I'll head north.


The Hot Gates?


Move out!


Move out!


What shall we do?


What can we do?


What can you do?


Sparta will need sons.


Spartan!


Yes, milady?


Come back with your shield...


...or on it.


Yes, milady.


"Goodbye, my love."


He doesn't say it.


There's no room for softness...


... not in Sparta.


No place for weakness.


Only the hard and strong
may call themselves Spartans.


Only the hard. Only the strong.


We march...


... for our lands, for our families,
for our freedoms.


We march.


Daxos.


- What a pleasant surprise.
- This morning's full of surprises, Leonidas.


- We've been tricked.
- Can't be more than a hundred.


- This is a surprise.
- Silence.


This isn't their army.


We heard Sparta was on the warpath
and we were eager to join forces.


If it is blood you seek,
you are welcome to join us.


But you bring only this handful
of soldiers against Xerxes?


I see I was wrong to expect Sparta's
commitment to at least match our own.


Doesn't it?


You, there.


What is your profession?


I'm a potter, sir.


And you, Arcadian.
What is your profession?


- Sculptor, sir.
- Sculptor.


- And you?
- Blacksmith.


Spartans! What is your profession?


You see, old friend?


I brought more soldiers than you did.


No sleep tonight...


... not for the king.


All his 40 years
have been a straight road...


... to this one gleaming moment
in destiny...


... this one radiant clash
of shield and spear...


... sword and bone, and flesh and blood.


His only regret...


... is that he has so few to sacrifice.


We're being followed.


It has followed us since Sparta.


My king! Look!


What happened here?


Where are all the people?


Persians.


I put their number at around 20.


A scouting party.


But these footprints...


Behind us!


Child!


It's quiet now.


They...


They came with beasts
from the blackness.


With their claws and fangs...


...they grabbed them.


Everyone...


...but me.


The villagers.


I found them.


Have the gods no mercy?


We are doomed.


Quiet yourself.


The child speaks of the Persian ghosts,
known from the ancient times.


They are the hunters of men's souls.


They cannot be killed or defeated.


Not this darkness. Not these lmmortals.


Immortals?


We'll put their name to the test.


Into the Hot Gates we march.


Into that narrow corridor we march...


... where Xerxes' numbers
count for nothing.


Spartans, citizen-soldiers, freed slaves.


Brave Greeks, all.


Brothers, fathers, sons...


... we march.


For honor's sake, for duty's sake,
for glory's sake, we march.


Look! Persians.


Into hell's mouth we march.


Let's watch these motherless dogs...


...as they're embraced by the loving arms
of Greece herself. Come.


True.


It does look like rain.


Zeus stabs the sky with thunderbolts...


... and batters the Persian ships
with hurricane wind.


Glorious.


Only one among us
keeps his Spartan reserve.


Only he.


Only our king.


My queen?


My queen...


...the courtyard is a more fitting place
for a married woman.


I'm afraid gossip and protocol...


...are the least of my worries now,
councilman.


Is such secrecy needed?


How am I to trust beyond the walls
of my own home?


Even here, Theron has eyes and ears
which fuel Sparta with doubt and fear.


You speak as if all Sparta
conspires against you.


I wish it were only against me.


Many on our council
would vote to give all we have...


...and follow Leonidas...


...but you must show them favor.


And you can arrange for me
to speak to the council?


If it is reason they want,
I will let them know.


Know what, my queen?


Freedom isn't free at all.


That it comes with the highest of costs,
the cost of blood.


I will do my best to gather our council.


And its chamber
shall be filled with your voice.


- I'm in your debt.
- No.


Leonidas is my king as well as yours.


I saw those ships smash on the rocks.


How can this be?


We saw but a fraction of the monster
that is Xerxes' army.


There can be no victory here.


Why do you smile?


Arcadian...


...I have fought countless times...


...yet I've never met an adversary
who could offer me...


...what we Spartans
call "a beautiful death."


I can only hope...


...with all the world's warriors
gathered against us...


...there might be one down there
who's up to the task.


Move!


Keep going, you dogs!


Move!


Forward, I say!


Stop here!


Who commands here?


I am the emissary...


...to the ruler of all the world...


...the god of gods, king of kings...


...and by that authority...


...I demand that someone
show me your commander.


Listen. Do you think the paltry dozen
you slew scares us?


These hills swarm with our scouts.


And do you think your pathetic wall
will do anything...


...except fall like a heap of dry leaves
in the face of...?


Our ancestors built this wall...


...using ancient stones
from the bosom of Greece herself.


And with a little Spartan help...


...your Persian scouts supplied the mortar.


You will pay for your barbarism!


My arm!


It's not yours anymore.


Go now. Run along and tell your Xerxes
he faces free men here...


...not slaves.


Do it quickly...


...before we decide to make our wall
just a little bit bigger.


No.


Not slaves.


Your women will be slaves.


Your sons, your daughters...


...your elders will be slaves!


But not you, no.


By noon this day you will be dead men.


A thousand nations of the Persian Empire
descend upon you.


Our arrows will blot out the sun.


Then we will fight in the shade.


The wall is solid.


It'll do the job of funneling the Persians
into the Hot Gates.


Have the men found any route
through the hills to our back?


None, sire.


There is such a route, good king.


Just pass that western ridge.


It's an old goat path.


The Persians could use it to outflank us.


Not one step closer, monster!


Wise king, I humbly request an audience.


- I'll skewer you where you stand.
- I gave no such order.


Forgive the captain.


He is a good soldier...


...but a bit short on manners.


There is nothing to forgive, brave king.
I know what I look like.


You wear the crimson of a Spartan.


I am Ephialtes, born of Sparta.


My mother's love
led my parents to flee Sparta...


...lest I be discarded.


Your shield and armor?


My father's, sir.


I beg you, bold king,
to permit me...


...to redeem my father's name
by serving you in combat.


My father trained me to feel no fear,
to make spear and shield and sword...


...as much a part of me
as my own beating heart.


I will earn my father's armor, noble king...


...by serving you in the battle.


A fine thrust.


I will kill many Persians.


Raise your shield.


- Sire?
- Raise your shield as high as you can.


Your father should have taught you
how our phalanx works.


We fight...


...as a single, impenetrable unit.


That is the source of our strength.


Each Spartan protects the man
to his left...


...from thigh to neck with his shield.


A single weak spot
and the phalanx shatters.


From thigh to neck, Ephialtes.


I am sorry, my friend.


- But not all of us were made to be soldiers.
- But I...


- lf you want to help in a Spartan victory...
- Yes.


...clear the battlefield of the dead,
tend the wounded, bring them water...


...but as for the fight itself...


...I cannot use you.


You...


Mother! Father! You were wrong!


You are wrong!


Leonidas! You are wrong!


Dispatch the Phocians to the goat path...


...and pray to the gods
nobody tells the Persians about it.


Earthquake.


No, captain.


Battle formations.


This is where we hold them.


This is where we fight!


This is where they die!


Earn these shields, boys!


Remember this day, men...


...for it will be yours for all time.


Spartans!


Lay down your weapons!


Persians!


Come and get them!


Hold!


Give them nothing...


...but take from them everything!


Steady!


Push!


Is that the best you can do?


Push! Push!


Now!


Push!


No prisoners!


No mercy!


They look thirsty.


Well, let's give them something to drink.


To the cliffs.


Halt.


Hell of a good start.


Tuck tail!


Persian cowards.


- What the hell are you laughing at?
- Well, you had to say it.


- What?
- "Fight in the shade."


Recover.


Today no Spartan dies.


Easy, son.


We do what we were trained to do...


... what we were bred to do...


... what we were born to do.


No prisoners. No mercy.


A good start.


- I was afraid you might not come.
- I'm sorry, my son is...


Is doing what children do best.
Please, don't apologize.


Your son starts the agoge next year.


That is always a difficult time
for a Spartan mother.


Yes, it will be hard. But also necessary.


You will speak before the council
in two days' time.


My husband does not have two days.


Think of the two days as a gift.


It's no secret...


...Theron wants what you control.


It's his voice you must silence.


Make him your ally...


...and you will have your victory.


Thank you.


You are wise as you are kind.


There's your mother.


You should keep a better eye on him
if he's to be king one day.


Be unfortunate if anything
were to happen to him.


Or to his beautiful mother.


No!


Our Greek comrades are begging
for a crack at the Persians, sire.


Good.


I've got something
I think they can handle.


Tell Daxos that I want him...


...and 20 of his best eager, sober
and ready for the next charge.


King Leonidas.


- Stelios, catch your breath, boy.
- Yes, milord.


The Persians are approaching.


A small contingent.
Too small for an attack.


- Captain, I leave you in charge.
- But sire...


Relax, old friend.


If they assassinate me,
all of Sparta goes to war.


Pray they're that stupid.


Pray...


...we're that lucky.


Besides...


...there's no reason we can't be civil...


...is there?


None, sire.


Let me guess.


You must be Xerxes.


Come, Leonidas.


Let us reason together.


It would be a regrettable waste...


...it would be nothing short of madness
were you, brave king...


...and your valiant troops to perish...


...all because of a simple
misunderstanding.


- There's much our cultures could share.
- Haven't you noticed?


We've been sharing our culture
with you all morning.


Yours is a fascinating tribe.


Even now you are defiant...


...in the face of annihilation
and the presence of a god.


It isn't wise to stand against me,
Leonidas.


Imagine what a horrible fate
awaits my enemies...


...when I would gladly kill
any of my own men for victory.


And I would die for any one of mine.


You Greeks take pride in your logic.
I suggest you employ it.


Consider the beautiful land
you so vigorously defend.


Picture it reduced to ash at my whim.


Consider the fate of your women.


Clearly you don't know our women.


I might as well have marched them up here,
judging by what I've seen.


You have many slaves, Xerxes...


...but few warriors.


It won't be long
before they fear my spears...


...more than your whips.


It's not the lash they fear...


...it is my divine power.


But I am a generous god.
I can make you rich beyond all measure.


I will make you warlord of all Greece.


You will carry my battle standard
to the heart of Europa.


Your Athenian rivals...


...will kneel at your feet...


...if you will but kneel at mine.


You are generous...


...as you are divine...


...O king of kings.


Such an offer
only a madman would refuse.


But the...


The idea of kneeling, it's...


You see, slaughtering
all those men of yours has...


Well, it's left a nasty cramp in my leg...


...so kneeling will be hard for me.


There will be no glory in your sacrifice.


I will erase even the memory of Sparta
from the histories.


Every piece of Greek parchment
shall be burned.


Every Greek historian and every scribe
shall have their eyes put out...


...and their tongues
cut from their mouths.


Why, uttering the very name of Sparta
or Leonidas will be punishable by death.


The world will never know
you existed at all.


The world will know
that free men stood against a tyrant.


That few stood against many.


And before this battle was over...


...that even a god-king can bleed.


You fought well today...


...for a woman.


As did you.


Maybe if I'm injured,
you'll be able to keep up with me.


Perhaps I was so far ahead
you couldn't see me.


More likely offering your backside
to the Thespians.


Jealousy...


...does not become you, my friend.


Move it, men!


Pile those Persians high.


For unless I miss my guess...


...we're in for one wild night.


They have served the dark will
of Persian kings for 500 years.


Eyes as dark as night.


Teeth filed to fangs.


Soulless.


The personal guard to King Xerxes himself.
The Persian warrior elite.


The deadliest fighting force in all of Asia:


The Immortals.


The god-king has betrayed a fatal flaw:


Hubris.


Easy to taunt, easy to trick.


Before wounds and weariness
have taken their toll...


... the mad king
throws the best he has at us.


Xerxes has taken the bait.


Spartans, push!


Immortals.


We put their name to the test.


Father!


My king!


Arcadians, now!


Go! Show the Spartans what we can do.


Go!


They shout and curse...


... stabbing wildly,
more brawlers than warriors.


They make a wondrous mess of things.


Brave amateurs, they do their part.


Immortals.


They fail our king's test.


And a man who fancies himself a god...


... feels a very human chill
crawl up his spine.


To our king!


And our honored dead.


Whom will Xerxes dare to send next?
Whom?!


There's nothing that can stop us now!


Even the king allows himself
to hope for more than glory.


Such mad hope, but there it is:


"Against Asia's endless hordes,
against all odds, we can do it.


We can hold the Hot Gates.


We can win. "


Dawn.


Whips crack. Barbarians howl.


Those behind cry, "Forward!"


Those in front cry, "Back!"


Our eyes bear witness
to the grotesque spectacle...


... coughed forth from the darkest corner
of Xerxes' empire.


When muscle failed...


... they turned to their magic.


One hundred nations descend upon us,
the armies of all Asia.


Funneled into this narrow corridor,
their numbers count for nothing.


They fall by the hundreds.


We send the severed bodies
and the fragile hearts back to Xerxes' feet.


King Xerxes is displeased
with his generals.


He disciplines them.


Xerxes dispatches his monsters
from half the world away.


They're clumsy beasts...


... and the piled Persian dead are slippery.


- You still here?
- Somebody's gotta watch your back.


Not now, I'm a little busy.


Regroup!


Astinos!


My son!


Astinos!


No!


Day wears on.


We lose few...


... but each felled is a friend,
or dearest blood.


And upon seeing the headless body
of his own young son...


... the captain breaks rank.


He goes wild, blood-drunk.


The captain's cries of pain
at the loss of his son...


... are more frightening to the enemy
than the deepest battle drums.


It takes three men to restrain him
and bring him back to our own.


The day is ours.


No songs are sung.


Your gods were cruel to shape you so,
friend Ephialtes.


The Spartans, too...


...were cruel to reject you.


But I am kind.


Everything you could ever desire...


...every happiness you can imagine...


...every pleasure your fellow Greeks
and your false gods have denied you...


...I will grant you.


For I am kind.


Embrace me as your king
and as your god.


Yes.


Lead my soldiers to the hidden path
that enters behind the cursed Spartans...


...and your joys will be endless.


Yes! I want it all.


Wealth. Women.


And one more thing...


...I want a uniform.


Done.


You will find...


...I am kind.


Unlike the cruel Leonidas,
who demanded that you stand...


...I require only...


...that you kneel.


Beautiful night.


Yes, but I did not ask you here
for small talk, Theron.


You can be sure of that.


You never spared words with me.


Can I offer you something?
A drink, perhaps?


Is it poison?


I'm sorry to disappoint you,
it's only water.


I'm told it's been arranged for you
to go before the council.


Yes.


I need your help in winning votes
to send the army north to our king.


Yes.


I can see it,
the two of us standing together.


Me, politician. You, warrior.
Our voices as one.


But why would I want to do that?


It proves you care for a king who right now
fights for the very water we drink.


True.


But this is politics, not war.


Leonidas is an idealist.


I know your kind too well. You send men
to slaughter for your own gain.


Your husband, our king,
has taken 300 of our finest to slaughter.


He's broken our laws
and left without the council's consent.


- I'm simply a realist.
- You're an opportunist.


You're as foolish as Leonidas if you think
men don't have a price in this world.


All men are not created equal.
That's the Spartan code, my little queen.


I admire your passion.


But don't think that you...


...a woman, even a queen...


...can walk into the council chamber
and sway the minds of men.


I own that chamber...


...as if it were built with these hands.


I could crush
the life out of you right now.


You will go before the council,
but your words will fall on deaf ears.


Leonidas will receive no reinforcements,
and if he returns, without my help...


...he will go to jail or worse.


Do you love your Sparta?


Yes.


- And your king?
- I do.


Your husband fights for his land
and his love.


What do you have to offer...


...in return for my word
that I'll help you send our army north?


What does a realist want with his queen?


I think you know.


This will not be over quickly.


You will not enjoy this.


I'm not your king.


Dilios.


I trust that scratch
hasn't made you useless?


Hardly, my lord. It's just an eye.


The gods saw fit to grace me
with a spare.


My captain?


Curses the gods and mourns alone.


Leonidas!


We are undone.
Undone, I tell you. Destroyed.


Daxos, calm yourself.


Our hunchback traitor led Xerxes' lmmortals
to the hidden goat path behind us.


The Phocians you posted there
were scattered without a fight.


- This battle is over, Leonidas.
- This battle is over when I say it is over.


By morning, the lmmortals will surround us.
The Hot Gates will fall.


Spartans! Prepare for glory!


Glory? Have you gone mad?


There is no glory to be had now.


Only retreat or surrender. Or death.


Well, that's an easy choice
for us, Arcadian.


Spartans never retreat.
Spartans never surrender.


Go spread the word.


Let every Greek assembled
know the truth of this.


Let each among them
search his own soul.


And while you're at it, search your own.


My men will leave with me.


Godspeed, Leonidas.


Children!


Children.


Gather round.


No retreat, no surrender.


That is Spartan law.


And by Spartan law,
we will stand and fight...


...and die.


A new age has begun.


An age of freedom.


And all will know that 300 Spartans...


...gave their last breath to defend it.


My friend.


I have lived my entire life
without regret until now.


It's not that my son
gave up his life for his country.


It's just that I never told him
that I loved him the most.


That he stood by me with honor.


That he was all that was best in me.


My heart is broken for your loss.


Heart?


I have filled my heart...


...with hate.


Good.


Dilios...


...let's take a walk.


Yes, my lord.


But, sire, I am fit and ready for battle.


That you are, one of the finest.


But you have another talent
unlike any other Spartan.


You will deliver my final orders
to the council...


...with force and verve.


Tell them our story.


Make every Greek know
what happened here.


You'll have a grand tale to tell.


A tale of victory.


Victory.


Yes, my lord.


Sire, any message...?


For the queen?


None that need be spoken.


Hundreds leave.


A handful stay.


Only one looks back.


Spartans!


Ready your breakfast and eat hearty...


...for tonight we dine in hell!


May I give the floor now...


...to the wife of Leonidas
and queen of Sparta.


- What's this?
- This is nothing.


Councilmen...


...I stand before you
not only as your queen.


I come to you as a mother.


I come to you as a wife.


I come to you as a Spartan woman.


I come to you with great humility.


I am not here to represent Leonidas.


His actions speak louder
than my words ever could.


I am here for all those voices
which cannot be heard.


Mothers, daughters, fathers, sons.


Three hundred families
that bleed for our rights...


...and for the very principles
this room was built upon.


We are at war, gentlemen.


We must send the entire Spartan army
to aid our king...


...in the preservation of not just ourselves,
but of our children.


Send the army
for the preservation of liberty.


Send it for justice.


Send it for law and order.


Send it for reason.


But most importantly,
send our army for hope.


Hope that a king and his men have not
been wasted to the pages of history.


That their courage bonds us together.


That we are made stronger
by their actions...


...and that your choices today
reflect their bravery.


Three hundred.


We must send them.


Moving...


...eloquent, passionate.


But it doesn't change the fact
that your husband has brought war upon us.


You are wrong.
Xerxes brought it forth...


...and before that,
his father Darius at Marathon.


The Persians will not stop...


...until the only shelter we will find
is rubble and chaos.


This chamber needs no
history lesson, my queen.


Then what is the lesson
you would like to leave?


Shall I begin to enumerate all of them?


Honor. Duty. Glory.


You speak of honor, duty and glory?


But what of adultery?


- How dare you.
- How dare I?


Watch her carefully.


She is a trickster in true form.


Do not play with the members
of this sacred chamber, my queen.


Just hours ago,
you offered yourself to me.


Were I a weaker man,
I would have her scent on me still.


- This is outrage.
- Oh, the hypocrite speaks!


Did you not receive a similar payment,
which you took...


...in exchange for her having an audience
with these noble men?


- That is a lie.
- Is it?


Was he not, by your invitation,
asked to come to the king's bedchamber?


The very bed where you attempted
to negotiate with me so vigorously?


You look shocked.
A bribe of the flesh, gentlemen...


...while her husband
promotes anarchy and war.


He speaks truth.


Words escape
even the most cunning tongue...


...my little whore queen.


What queen-like behavior.


Remove her from this chamber
before she infects us further...


...with her inglorious and shabby self.


This will not be over quickly.


You will not enjoy this.
I am not your queen.


Traitor.


Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!


Traitor!


Leonidas, my compliments
and congratulations.


You surely have turned calamity
into victory.


Despite your insufferable arrogance...


...the god-king has come
to admire Spartan valor and fighting skill.


You will make a mighty ally.


Yield, Leonidas.


Use your reason. Think of your men.


I beg you.


Listen to your fellow Greek.


He can attest
to the divine one's generosity.


Despite your several insults,
despite your horrid blasphemies...


...the lord of hosts
is prepared to forgive all...


...and more, to reward your service.


You fight for your lands.


Keep them.


You fight for Sparta.


She will be wealthier and more powerful
than ever before.


You fight for your kingship.


You will be proclaimed warlord
of all Greece...


...answerable only
to the one true master of the world.


Leonidas, your victory will be complete...


...if you but lay down your arms...


...and kneel to holy Xerxes.


It's been more than 30 years
since the wolf in the winter cold.


And now, as then,
it's not fear that grips him...


... only restlessness.
A heightened sense of things.


The seaborne breeze coolly kissing
the sweat at his chest and neck.


Gulls cawing...


... complaining even as they feast
on the thousands of floating dead.


The steady breathing
of the 300 at his back...


... ready to die for him
without a moment's pause.


Every one of them...


... ready to die.


His helmet is stifling.


His shield is heavy.


Your spear.


You there...


...Ephialtes.


May you live forever.


Leonidas, your spear.


Stelios!


Slaughter them!


His helmet was stifling.


It narrowed his vision,
and he must see far.


His shield was heavy.
It threw him off balance...


... and his target is far away.


The old ones say we Spartans
are descended from Hercules himself.


Bold Leonidas gives testament
to our bloodline.


His roar is long and loud.


My king.


It's an honor to die at your side.


It's an honor to have lived at yours.


My queen!


My wife.


My love.


"Remember us."


As simple an order as a king can give.


"Remember why we died."


For he did not wish tribute or song...


...nor monuments,
nor poems of war and valor.


His wish was simple.


"Remember us"...


...he said to me.


That was his hope.


Should any free soul
come across that place...


... in all the countless
centuries yet to be...


... may all our voices...


... whisper to you
from the ageless stones.


Go tell the Spartans, passerby...


... that here, by Spartan law, we lie.


And so my king died...


... and my brothers died...


...barely a year ago.


Long I pondered my king's
cryptic talk of victory.


Time has proven him wise.


For from free Greek to free Greek...


...the word was spread
that bold Leonidas and his 300...


...so far from home...


...laid down their lives
not just for Sparta...


...but for all Greece
and the promise this country holds.


Now, here on this rugged patch of earth
called Plataea...


...Xerxes' hordes face obliteration!


Just there the barbarians huddle...


...sheer terror gripping tight their hearts...


...with icy fingers...


...knowing full well
what merciless horrors they suffered...


...at the swords and spears of 300.


Yet they stare now across the plain
at 10,000 Spartans...


...commanding 30,000 free Greeks!


The enemy outnumber us
a paltry three to one.


Good odds for any Greek.


This day, we rescue a world
from mysticism and tyranny...


...and usher in a future
brighter than anything we can imagine.


Give thanks, men...


...to Leonidas and the brave 300.


To victory!
